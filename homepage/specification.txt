### **JavaScript Feature**

- I implemented a **Dark Mode Toggle** that allows the user to switch between a light and dark mode. This was achieved through a simple JavaScript script that adds or removes the `dark-mode` class upon toggling the switch, dynamically changing the design of the page.

### **Bootstrap Feature**

- I used **Bootstrap's grid system** for the layout to make the page responsive. Specifically, I used Bootstrap components like `navbar` for the navigation menu and `btn-primary` for buttons to quickly and easily style the page.
